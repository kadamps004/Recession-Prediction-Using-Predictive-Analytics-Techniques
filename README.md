This Project aims to predict recession using data from 1977 to 2019. These are the prediction models used: Linear Model, Naive Bayes, and time series model. The prediction models are coded in R. R file is uploaded the same, and results are attached accordingly. 

Linear model provides the best way to train model to predict recession. Linear models are often used for predicting a recession because they are simple and easy to interpret. Additionally, linear models assume that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear, which can be a reasonable assumption in many cases.!
