# Recession-Precession-Using-Predictive-Analytics-Techniques

This Project aims to predict recession using data from 1977 to 2019. These are the prediction models used: Linear Model, Naive Bayes, and time series model. The prediction models are coded in R. R file is uploaded the same, and results are attached accordingly. 

Linear model provides the best way to train model to predict recession. Linear models are often used for predicting a recession because they are simple and easy to interpret. Additionally, linear models assume that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear, which can be a reasonable assumption in many cases.![image](https://github.com/kadamps004/Recession-Precession-Using-Predictive-Analytics-Techniques/assets/22448588/52e44540-41bb-4cc6-bc4d-9c3235498a7c)


Predicting a recession is crucial because it can have a significant impact on the economy, including job losses, lower consumer spending, decreased business investment, and decreased tax revenues. By predicting a recession, policymakers, businesses, and individuals can take steps to mitigate its effects. Financial market participants and policymakers are interested in predicting a recession as business cycles have an impact on both financial markets and the actual economy. Industries greatly impacted by recession include retail, restaurants, travel & tourism, real estate, and manufacturing. Predicting a recession helps to reduce uncertainty and promote economic stability.
